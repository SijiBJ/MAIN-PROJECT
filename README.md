# Robust Encryption of Quantum Medical Images

Security of medical media is important for patient safety and confidentiality. Here  a framework for the chaos-based quantum encryption of healthcare images is used. In the framework, healthcare staff in one location send cipher images . Another healthcare staff can decrypt the content of the images,and he/she can assist users in a secure manner. Here a novel approach is used for the efficient quantum image encryption of healthcare media. The algorithm utilizes gray code and a chaotic map. The quantum image is scrambled by quantum gray code. Then, the scrambled quantum image is encrypted using a quantum XOR operation based on a key generator controlled by the logistic-sine map. The encryption/decryption algorithm are devised based on an NEQR quantum image representation.This quantum image encryption approach is robust, realizable, and has high efficiency compared with its classical counterpart.
